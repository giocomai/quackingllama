The goal of `quackingllama` is to facilitate efficient interactions with LLMs; its current target use-case is text classification (e.g. categorise or tag contents, or extract information from text). Key features include:

- facilitate consistently formatted responses (through [Ollama's structured ouputs](https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs))
- facilitate local caching (by storing results in a local `DuckDB` database)
- facilitate initiating text classification tasks (through examples and convenience functions)
- facilitate keeping a record with details about how each response has been received


## Installation

You can install the development version of `quackingllama` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("giocomai/quackingllama")
```

## Default options and outputs

In order to facilitate consistent results, by default `quackingllama` sets the temperature of the model to 0: this means that it will always return the same response when given the same prompt. When caching is enabled, responses can then consistently be retrieved from the local cache without querying again the LLMs. 

All functions consistently return results in a data frame (a tibble).

Key functionalities will be demonstrated through a series of examples.

As the package is developed further, some of the less intuitive tasks (e.g. defining a schema) will be facilitated through dedicated convenience functions.


## Basic examples

### Text generation


```{r example}
library("quackingllama")
```

Let's generate a short piece of text. Results are returned in a data frame, with the `response` in the first column and all relevant metadata about the query stored along with it. 

```{r pol_df}
pol_df <- ql_generate(prompt = "Describe an imaginary political leader in less than 100 words.")

str(pol_df)
```

```{r pol_df response, results='asis'}
cat(">", pol_df$response)
```

If we are interested in variations of this text, we can easily create them:

```{r pol3_df}
# TODO accept multiple prompts by default

pol3_df <- purrr::map(
  .x = c("progressive", "conservative", "centrist"),
  .f = \(x) {
    ql_generate(prompt = glue::glue("Describe an imaginary {x} politician in less than 100 words."))
  }
) |>
  purrr::list_rbind()

pol3_df$response
```

These are, as it is the customary default behaviour of LLMs, free form texts. Depending on the task at hand, we may want to have text in a more structured format. To do so, we must provide the LLM with a [schema](https://json-schema.org/) of how we want it to to return data. 

Schema can be very simple, e.g., if we want our response to feature only a "name" and "description" field, and both should be character strings, we'd use the following schema:


```{r basic_schema}
# TODO convenience function to facilitate creation of common schemas

schema <- list(
  type = "object",
  properties = list(
    `name` = list(type = "string"),
    `description` = list(type = "string")
  ),
  required = c("name", "description")
)
```


```{r pol_schema_df basic}
pol_schema_df <- ql_generate(
  prompt = "Describe an imaginary political leader.",
  format = schema
)

pol_schema_df$response |>
  yyjsonr::read_json_str()
```


or slightly more complex, for example making clear that we expect a field to be numeric, and another one to pick between one of a set of options:



```{r medium_schema}
schema <- list(
  type = "object",
  properties = list(
    `name` = list(type = "string"),
    `age` = list(type = "number"),
    `gender` = list(
      type = "string",
      enum = c("female", "male", "non-binary")
    ),
    `motto` = list(type = "string"),
    `description` = list(type = "string")
  ),
  required = c(
    "name",
    "age",
    "gender",
    "motto",
    "description"
  )
)
```

And the returned is formatted as expected:

```{r pol_schema_df medium}
pol_schema_df <- ql_generate(
  prompt = "Describe an imaginary political leader.",
  format = schema
)

pol_schema_df$response |>
  yyjsonr::read_json_str()
```


Having the response in a structured format allows for easily storing results in a data frame and processing them further. 


```{r pol3_schema_df}
pol3_schema_df <- purrr::map(
  .x = c("progressive", "conservative", "centrist"),
  .f = \(x) {
    ql_generate(
      prompt = glue::glue("Describe an imaginary {x} politician."),
      format = schema
    )
  }
) |>
  purrr::list_rbind()

pol3_schema_responses_df <- purrr::map(
  .x = pol3_schema_df$response,
  .f = \(x) {
    yyjsonr::read_json_str(x) |>
      tibble::as_tibble()
  }
) |>
  purrr::list_rbind()

pol3_schema_responses_df
```

This has obvious advantages for many data processing tasks, and, as will be seen, can effectively be used to enhance the consistency of text classification tasks. But first, let's discuss caching and some of the options that determine output. 

### Caching and options

So far, local caching has not been enabled: this means that even when the exacts same response is expected, this will still be requested to the LLM, which can be exceedingly time-consuming especially for repetitive tasks, or for data processing pipelines that may recurrently encounter the same data.

Caching is the obvious answer to this process, but when do we expect exactly the same response from the LLM, considering that LLMs do not necessarily return the same response even when given the same prompt?

Two parameters are particularly relevant for understanding this, `temperature` and `seed`.

What is "temperature"? [Ollama's documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md#valid-parameters-and-values) concisely clarifies the effect of this parameter by suggesting that "Increasing the temperature will make the model answer more creatively." LLMs often have the default temperature set to 0.7 or 0.8. In brief, when temperature is set to its maximum value of 1, the LLMs will provide more varied responses. When temperature is set to 0, the LLMs are at their more consistent: they always provide the same response to the same prompt.

What does it mean in practices? For example, that if I set the temperature to 0 and ask the same LLM to generate a haiku, I will always get the very same haiku, no matter how many times I run this command.

```{r funny_haiku_temp0}
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 0)
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 0)
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 0)
```

If I set the temperature to 1, I get every time a different haiku (ok, not very different, really, but still different).

```{r funny_haiku_temp1}
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 1)
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 1)
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 1)
```

But then, replicability of results is possible even when the temperature is set to a value higher than 0. We just need to set the same seed, and we'll consistently get the same result.

```{r funny_haiku_temp1_seed2024}
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 1, seed = 2024)
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 1, seed = 2024)
ql_generate(prompt = "A funny haiku", temperature = 1, seed = 2024)
```

Two additional components determine if the response is exactly the same in different instances: `system` and `format`. The `system` parameter is passed along with the prompt to the LLM, and by default is set to the generic "You are a helpful assistant.". This is a reasonable generic option, but there may be good reasons to be more specific depending on the task at hand. 

For example, if we set as the system message "You are an 18th century poet.", the style of the response will change (somewhat) accordingly. 

```{r funny_haiku_temp0_18th_century}
ql_generate(
  prompt = "A funny haiku",
  temperature = 0,
  system = "You are an 18th century poet."
)
```

As discussed above, `format` is relevant only for instances when a structured output is requested to the LLM by providing a schema. For example, if we provided a different schema, the output would also have been different.

```{r different schema}
schema <- list(
  type = "object",
  properties = list(
    `haiku` = list(type = "string"),
    `why_funny` = list(type = "string")
  ),
  required = c(
    "haiku",
    "why_funny"
  )
)

haiku_str_df <- ql_generate(
  prompt = "Write a funny haiku, and explain why it is supposed to be funny.",
  format = schema
)

haiku_str_df |>
  dplyr::pull(response) |>
  yyjsonr::read_json_str()
```


In brief, when should we expect to receive exactly the same response from the LLM, hence, making it possible to retrieve it from cache if already parsed? The following conditions must apply:

- same model
- same `system` parameter
- same `format`, i.e., same schema (if given).
- same prompt
- and
  - either the same seed and any value for `temperature` OR
  - any seed and `temperature` set to zero

If the above conditions are met, and caching is enabled, the response will be retrieved from the local cache, rather than from the LLM. 

It's easy to enable caching for the current session with `ql_enable_db()`. By default, the database is stored in the current working directory, but this can be changed with `ql_set_db_options()`.


```{r enable db}
ql_enable_db()
ql_set_db_options(db_folder = fs::path_home_r("R"))
```

Now even prompts that would take the LLM many seconds to process can be returned efficiently from cache:

```{r long story from cache}
invisible(
  ql_generate(
    prompt = "A long story",
    temperature = 1,
    system = "You are an 18th century poet.",
    seed = 42
  )
)

before <- Sys.time()
ql_generate(
  prompt = "A long story",
  temperature = 1,
  system = "You are an 18th century poet.",
  seed = 42
)
after <- Sys.time()

after - before
```
