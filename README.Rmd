The goal of `quackingllama` is to facilitate processing text with Ollama, and store results in DuckDB.

For example: you need to categorise or tag contents, but don't want to take care of the caching... `quackingllama` is there to make things easier. 

Coming soon.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `quackingllama` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("giocomai/quackingllama")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(quackingllama)
```


### About the hex logo

In the logo you may or may not recognise a quacking llama, or mayb, just a llama wearing a duck mask. Generated on my machine with `stablediffusion`.
